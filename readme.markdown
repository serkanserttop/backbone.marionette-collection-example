Backbone.Marionette Collection Example + Sorting with Comparator
======================================

Please check below for the original readme.
I extended that example with basic sorting, decided to share it.
I may write a tutorial for it later.

PS: I did not touch the parts that deal with rankUp and rankDown.
They affect votes as well, the reason for such functionality seemed a bit confusing to me.
But I am not interested in their functionality, just beware when you click up and down.

Demo is at http://jsbin.com/opakov/3
Some css is overridden by the service, but the functionality is OK.
